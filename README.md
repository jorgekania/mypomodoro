This application aims to help you with time management using the **POMODORO** technique, don't you know what this technique is? Below is a brief explanation of how it works and how it can help you with your day-to-day tasks.

# What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The technique, in fact, was developed in the late 80s by the Italian Francesco Cirillo, who was looking for a way to increase his productivity in studies during his first years at university. To do this, he used a kitchen timer to organize his tasks.

# How does Pomodoro work?

The technique is based on the idea that by dividing our workflow into blocks of intense concentration, we can improve brain agility and stimulate our focus. In other words, we improve our time management and become more efficient. Therefore, to put it into practice you will need:

* Timer or stopwatch to count down
*  A to-do list
*  Pencil and eraser

First, you must make a list of tasks to be performed during the day. Then, simply divide your time into 25-minute periods (called “pomodoros”) and work uninterruptedly on your tasks in these periods.


When the timer rings (at the end of the first 25 minutes), put an X through the completed tasks or write down the status of your work (50% complete, for example) and take a short 5-minute break. During this break, take the opportunity to do other things unrelated to the task (go to the bathroom, call a client, have a coffee, etc.).

After every four cycles, take a longer break (between 15 and 30 minutes) to rest. These breaks between pomodoros are essential for “oxygenating your brain” and increasing mental agility. Furthermore, it is worth remembering that these time measurements are only those suggested in the classic method. Nothing stops you from finding your own balance and ideal rest period.

# What are the results of the Pomodoro method?

The objectives of the Pomodoro technique are linked to reducing anxiety and increasing focus and concentration on tasks, avoiding wasted time and distractions.

By writing down what needs to be done on paper, you can not only better organize your activities, but also set goals for each day or period. This makes it easier to monitor your results and progress.

After a few days using the technique, you may notice some benefits such as the ability to understand and discover:

* How long does it take to perform each type of task;
* What distracts you repeatedly;
* What are the main interruptions in your work.

An interesting way to find out how your time management is going is by doing the following reflections:

1. Do you study and work until you are tired or do you take breaks frequently?
2. Before starting, do you make a list of the tasks to be performed or do you try to remember them in your head?
3. Do you know what the main causes of interruptions in your work are?
4. Estimate the time you will spend on a certain activity and then check whether it was efficient?
5. Do you work well in the race against the clock?


Thinking about this is important so that you can better understand your own work rhythm.
